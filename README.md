Task 1: 
A program that will output 'Yes',
if the value of both numbers number1 and number2 are between 0 and 1, and 'No' otherwise.
Number1 and number2 will have the data type double.
It is advisable to enter number 1 and number2 through the console,
but you can also set them explicitly in the code.

Task 2:
A program that prints prime numbers in the range [2, 100] to the console. 
Used the "%" (remainder) operator and loops to solve this problem.

Task 3:
A program that takes a number and outputs all odd numbers from 1 to that number inclusive.

Task 4: 
A program that displays the factorial of the entered number on the console. 
The factorial of a natural number n is defined as the product of all natural numbers from 1 to n inclusive.

Task 5:
A program that finds the greatest common divisor for the numbers number1 and number2.
It is advisable to enter the numbers through the console,
but you can also explicitly specify them in the code.

Task 6: 
A program that will check whether the entered number is prime or not.
A prime number is a natural (positive whole) number that has exactly two different natural divisors - one and itself.
